<p class="text-left">When you visit some advertising website to find a job or look for a new car or anything else they often ask you to save the search, so they can send you an e-mail in case anybody add advert that meet your requirements.</p>
<p class="text-left">You have a table where you store informations about something and another table where you have search parameters for agents. For example let's have a site for job advertising. It has job type ( e. g. administration, sales, IT, ... ), title, description and location.</p>
<p class="text-left">I am looking for IT, title that contains PHP and location is Norway. My friend wants to work with me, but in sales. The parameters are simple - { IT, PHP, Norway } and { sales, Norway }. The problems shows up very soon. </p>
