<p class="text-left">When you are applying for nearly any job in IT, you should know something about databases.
    It really doesn't matter if it is web development, Android / iOS, or anything else. More or less you will get in
    touch with databases.</p>
<p class="text-left">When working with Android or iOS, lot of information is saved in SQLite, like contacts, messages, 
    music library, etc. Chat apps saves their history in SQLite and they do it on desktop too. The same it is with
    web developers, but they are not working with SQLite, but with databases like MySQL, MS SQL or NoSQL databases.</p>
