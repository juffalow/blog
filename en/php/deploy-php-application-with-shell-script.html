<p class="text-left">Do you copy the whole project ( or modified files only ) everytime you change something? Are there many things you have to care about when deoploing new version?</p>
<p class="text-left">Deployment process can be very easy, but it can get more complex fast. You start to use Composer or some CSS preporcessor and there it is. Before it can be run, you have to download all dependencies and create CSS files. Doing this all the time will drive you crazy.</p>
<p class="text-left">There are lot of things you may want from a deploy script, so I divide this to more blog posts, each about different part of deploy process. E.g.:</p>
<ul>

    <li>clone specific branch from GitHub</li>
    <li>check files with PHP lint</li>
    <li>run Composer and if there are tests available, run them too</li>
    <li>check javascript with JS lint</li>
    <li>install Node modules and run grunt / gulp / webpack</li>
    <li>create new version tag</li>
    <li>copy files to server</li>
</ul>
