<p class="text-left">This will be very short post. I haven't use this command before and nowadays I was reading something about git where this command was used. I do not consider myself as an expert in git. There are still many features I am not using or I don't know about. So I googled it...</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="commit-that-introduced-a-bug">Commit that introduced a bug</h2>
<p class="text-left">The first result on google is the git docs page, where you can read :</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>git-bisect - Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug</p>
  <footer><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git</a></footer>
</blockquote>
<p class="text-left">What does this mean? I use simple example but it can be extended and used to search any change in the source code ( not only bugs ). So to demonstrate it, I create a bash script and commit after each line.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="initialize-git-repo">Initialize git repo</h4>
<pre class="prettyprint">
cd ~/Documents
mkdir bisecttest
cd bisecttest

touch script.sh
chmod +x script.sh

git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
</pre>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="good-and-working-part">Good and working part</h4>
<p class="text-left">Open the file <code>script.sh</code> in your favorite editor and add these lines :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash
echo "1 : ok"
</pre>
<p class="text-left">And commit. ( <kbd>git add . && git commit -m "number 1 commit"</kbd> ). Append new line <code>echo "2 : ok"</code> and commit again. Repeat this 3 times. You end up with this :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
#!/bin/bash
echo "1 : ok" # number 1 commit
echo "2 : ok" # number 2 commit
echo "3 : ok" # number 3 commit
echo "4 : ok" # number 4 commit
echo "5 : ok" # number 5 commit
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Run the script and it should write numbers from 1 to 5 on the screen.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="bad-and-not-working-part">Bad and not working part</h4>
<p class="text-left">Now, create the error ( buggy ) part somewhere in around the middle of the script, lets say between <code>echo "3 : ok"</code> and <code>echo "4 : ok"</code>. In the script it means, exit with an error code number. E.g.:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
...
echo "3 : ok"
exit 1
echo "4 : ok"
...
</pre>
<p class="text-left">In real world you know this would screw up the whole thing, but now you are happy to commit new line ( <kbd>git add . && git commit -m "error commit"</kbd> ).</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="again-some-good-part">Again some good part</h4>
<p class="text-left">You added bug and haven't test the whole app. You continue like everything is working properly.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
echo "6 : ok" # number 6 commit
echo "7 : ok" # number 7 commit
echo "8 : ok" # number 8 commit
</pre>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="now-you-realize-something-is-wrong">Now you realize something is wrong</h4>
<p class="text-left">You run the script, it should write numbers from 1 to 8 on the output, but stops on the number 3. Why? Where did I ( or whoever ) make a mistake? You can try and search in code or use <kbd>git bisect</kbd>!</p>
<p class="text-left">You know it was working 5 - 6 commits ago and now it is not ( this is very important ). You run command :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git bisect start
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Git switch itself into a "debug mode". Mark current version as bad :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git bisect bad
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Checkout working commit / tag and mark it as good ( 6 commits ago is <code>number 3 commit</code> ) :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git checkout HEAD~6

git bisect good
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Now, git knows which version is bad, where in history it was good and begin to search. How? It automatically ( after you enter one bad and one good commit ) checkouts a commit in the middle of that range of history. You run the script and see if it is good or bad.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">This is easy, but remember, it can be whatever. If it is a webpage, reload it and check if the bug is still there. If it is an Android app, compile it, install and try it.</div>
<p class="text-left">After you typed that command, git jumped in the middle of this commit and the first good commit. Therefore the position is on <code>error commit</code>. In that commit we introduced the bug which means it is a bad one.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git bisect bad
</pre>
<p class="text-left">There remains only one commit to check - <code>number 5 commit</code> - that is good.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
git bisect good
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Now, it is obvious that the error occurred in <code>error commit</code>. Git shows message like this :</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
