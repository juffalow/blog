<p class="text-left">When I am speaking with someone who introduce himself as programmer or generally IT, I want to know what is he doing, some best practices, what technology does he / she like, and so on. But mostly it is really short conversation and we switch to some new topic. Why?</p>
<p class="text-left">If someone likes for example cycling and meet other biker, they can talk with each other for a long time, for example which bike brand does the other guy have, did he tried the one I am ridding, what is his favorite place / biker, etc. Why doesn't this work with programmers? No one likes it that much?</p>
<p class="text-left">Every day something happens. Every day there is something new and interesting.</p>
