<p class="text-left">When I am speaking with someone who introduce himself as programmer or generally IT, I want to know what is he doing, some best practices, what technology does he / she like, and so on. But mostly it is really short conversation and we switch to some new topic. Why?</p>
<p class="text-left">If someone likes for example cycling and meet other biker, they can talk with each other for a long time, for example which bike brand does the other guy have, did he tried the one I am ridding, what is his favorite place / biker, etc. Why doesn't this work with programmers? No one likes it that much?</p>
<p class="text-left">Every day something happens. Every day there is something new and interesting.</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="blogs">Blogs</h2>
<p class="text-left">There are lot of blogs on internet. Big companies like Google or Facebook has their own developers blog, so you can read what's going on there. Even programmers have blogs. Let's say you are working as Android developer, then you can find someone who is working with Android too and has his own blog and from time to time visit it.</p>

<p class="text-left">Blog from Jeff Atwood, co-founder of website <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>. Today I read couple of his posts, for example <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-im-the-best-programmer-in-the-world/">Why I'm The Best Programmer In The World</a>, where you can read it is not bad to admit you are not genius. It is good to ask friends / colleagues how would they solve your problem, or interpret them your solution to see if they don't have any suggestions.</p>

<p class="text-left">By asking and sharing your solutions and listening to "criticism" you move forward. And that's what it is all about. To be better than yesterday / year ago.</p>
