  <p>The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.</p>

<p class="text-left">The common solution for this is to use backtracking. It is a good practice and you understand the algorithm realy fast. But it still can be improved a little bit...</p>

<p class="text-left">I found this solution with very good explanation on internet. It uses only bitwise operations, therefore it is really fast. Originally, it was written in JavaScript, but I rewrote it in Go.</p>

<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="explanation">Explanation</h4>
<p class="text-left">When you see it for the first time, it can be a little bit confusing, but later you find it perfect. I suppose you are familiar that computer stores data as sequence of bits ( 5 = 0101 ). Now look on the code and see the variables <code>ld</code>, <code>col</code> and <code>rd</code>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>for N = 4, <code>col</code> having value of <code>0010</code> would mean that the 3rd column is already occupied by a queen</li>
    <li>for N = 8, <code>ld</code> having a value of <code>00011000</code> at row 5 would mean that the top-left-to-bottom-right diagonals that pass through columns 4 and 5 of that row are already occupied by queens</li>
</ul>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var done int
done = int(math.Pow(2, float64(n))) -1
</pre>
<p class="text-left">The algorithm will not break the chess rules, that means it doesn't place queen on the same row / column / diagonal with any other queen. So when every place in row is taken - the <code>col</code> variable has each of its bits set to <code>1</code> - we found one of the solutions. The <code>done</code> variable is used for this. If N = 4, we set its value to <code>2<sup>4</sup> - 1</code> = <code>15</code> = <code>1111</code> in binary.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
if col == done {
    count++
    return
}
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Here is the condition to check if we found one of the solutions. If each column is occupied, then <code>col</code> = <code>1111</code> and it corresponds to <code>done</code> value ( for N = 4 ).</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
poss := ^(ld | col | rd)
</pre>
<p class="text-left">In <code>ld</code>, <code>col</code> and <code>rd</code> are the queens positions for current row. When doing OR, we get all under attack positions in that row. Then negate (<code>^</code>) it to get free positions.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
bit := poss & -poss
poss -= bit
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Get the first available position and mark that position as taken in the current row.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
recursion((ld|bit)>>1, col|bit, (rd|bit)<<1)
</pre>
<p class="text-left">Move to next row. So you shift diagonals and mark new position in <code>col</code> variable.</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="text-left">When you have some problem to solve, it is good to try and solve it your way ( if you have time of course ) and then look for another solution(s) so you can compare it and learn something.</p>
