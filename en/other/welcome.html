<p class="text-justify">Welcome on my page. This article is the first article on this blog ( and even my first written article ) and it will be used as list of themes I want to write about. 
Themes about programming in PHP and Java together with the use of databases, design patterns and programming principles. Furthermore, something little from design ( CSS, Less ), versioning, Linux and other.</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="programming-in-various-languages">Programming in various languages</h2>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="php">PHP</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Here I want to begin with installation apache server and creating basic "Hello World!" project. Then a quick introduction to PHP, naming convenions, syntax, database connection, forms and file upload. 
Of course something about web security, SQL injection sample, XSS, XSRF. Creating registration form, user log in and password reset. Article "Tips & tricks" should be here also, where I want to write about interesting stuff I found and read, 
or problems I met. If I have time ( and will ) maybe an article about frameworks show up.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="java">Java</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Description of Java Virtual Machine and its parts. Mostly I want to write about data structures, show how trees, queues, lists, maps and so on works. Also using exceptions, how to deal deal with files, threads and sockets. 
Go through topics which you can meet on job interviews. Few articles I want to devote to Android - create "Hello World!" project, multi screen app, etc and of course describe registration and app sharing on Google Play.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="databases-and-sql">Databases and SQL</h4>
<p class="text-justify">This will be mostly about MySQL database, 'cause it is most widely used database system ( if SQLite not involved ). As everywhere else, beginning will be about data types, their limitations and usage. 
Then entities and relationships explanation, show how <i>joins</i> works, what is index, and so on. Later some advanced things like triggers and stored procedures, or full text search. Maybe how to store spatial data and search in them, or 
other database systems like PostgreSQL or SQLite.</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="programming-theory">Programming theory</h2>
<p class="text-justify">I think this is the most important theme. The syntax of a language one learns quickly, then just a little logical thinking and he is able to solve problems and produce usable applications. But...is that enough? 
For simple tasks and small projects yes, but once it comes to more complex staff, teamwork and so on, then it is different story. 
The code of this "programmer" is hard to read, mostly bad documented ( or not documented at all ) and it is complicated to extend it.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Everyone certainly met with a situation where he found his own code intricate and complicated. That it is the time to move a bit further again and start to use proven practices to some common issues and also think 
about the style of writing the code.</p>

<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="design-patterns">Design patterns</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Design pattern is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. They are grouped into several categories : creational, structural and behavioral patterns. They will be explained in UML with code implementation in PHP and Java.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="programming-principles">Programming principles</h4>
<p class="text-justify">This category is dedicated to principles such as DRY or SOLID. Of course, there are a lot more principles and they are important part of programming. Over time, I will try to find the most suitable examples and definitions of these principles and make them public.</p>

<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="other">Other</h2>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="frameworks-and-utilities">Frameworks and utilities</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Of course, not everything will be about programming itself. There are lot of other things that are worth attention. 
This can be for example preprocessor Less, which is used in CSS framework Bootstrap. Bootstrap is also using utility Grunt, which can be used to concatenate several 
javascript files and than minimize them, or test functions and more.</p>
<p class="text-justify">It does take a while till it is properly set up. Write it all to JSON and make it work is often annoying, but then, then the work is going faster and easier. 
You don't have to be afraid of new things or give up in the beginning.</p>

<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="versioning">Versioning</h4>
<p class="text-justify">An important part of the work is also version control. GIT and SVN are the most used solutions. Difference between these two and how to use GIT will be part of my blog either.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="seo">SEO</h4>
<p class="text-justify">This is relevant,but for programmer not very interesting, part. It is about site optimization for search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo and using tools like WebMaster Tools and Google Analytics.</p>
<h4 class="theme-subheading" id="linux">Linux</h4>
<p class="text-justify">The last bigger topic could be Linux operating system. Example of installation Linux Server ( LAMP ), most used commands and couple of problems which I met when using apache server and MySQL database. In the case I will be hyperactive, you will be able to find here article about virtualization and high availability.</p>
<h2 class="theme-subheading" id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="text-justify">I hope I did not miss anything important and if so, I will add and actualize ;-) For now, this is all. Good by and see you soon...</p>
